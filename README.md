# Pandemia in Russia 2020-2021
Russia has been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has spread across the country around the world. However, all-cause mortality, which increased during COVID-19, remains poorly understood due to deficiencies in surveillance and analytics. The problem of morbidity from Covid-19 has quickly developed into a critical situation for all residents, especially for the health care system. Unfortunately, it still poses a severe threat to the population. Mortality from all causes during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly higher than in previous years. In Russia, according to official data, 4.5 million people died (as of December 31, 2021). The author aims to estimate the change in mortality during the pandemic in Russia using data on mortality from all causes.
